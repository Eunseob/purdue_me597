Each homework is worth 3 pt credit. You have to submit each assignment in Jupyter Notebook format (*.ipynb) in time via Brightspace. No late submissions are accepted without the agreement of the instructor and TA. The due date of each homework is before the next tutorial. For example, if ML 3 start at 10:30 am on Feb. 9, the homework for ML 2 due is before 10:30 am on Feb. 9. Each assignment due will be posted on Brightspace."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jxfqYAPeak4E"},"source":["## Table of Content\n","---\n","### **Introduction**\n","\n","[Intro to Colab Notebooks](lab/intro/Introduction_to_Colab_Notebooks.ipynb) &nbsp;|&nbsp;\n","[Basics of Python](lab/lab0/Basics_of_Python.ipynb) &nbsp;|&nbsp;\n","\n","---\n","### **ML 1: Data analysis 1**\n","\n","[ML1-1: Exercise for data handling and plotting](ml_tutorial/ML1/ML1_Code1.ipynb)\\\n","[ML1-2: Exercise for data indexing](ml_tutorial/ML1/ML1_Code2.ipynb)\\\n","[ML1-3: Exercise for data processing](ml_tutorial/ML1/ML1_Code3.ipynb)\n","\n","\n","---\n","### **ML 2: Data analysis 2**\n","\n","[ML2-1: Exercise for signal processing 1 - FFT](ml_tutorial/ML2/ML2_Code1.ipynb)\\\n","[ML2-2: Exercise for signal processing 2 - STFT](ml_tutorial/ML2/ML2_Code2.ipynb)\\\n","[ML2-3: Exercise for signal processing 3 - WT](ml_tutorial/ML2/ML2_Code3.ipynb)\n","\n","---\n","### Homework 1\n","\n","[HW 1](ml_tutorial/HW/HW1.ipynb)  (Due: 10:30 am on Feb, 9)\n","\n","---\n","### **ML 3: Data analysis 3**\n","\n","[ML3-1: Feature extraction](ml_tutorial/ML3/ML3_Code1.ipynb)\\\n","[ML3-2: Feature selection (p-value)](ml_tutorial/ML3/ML3_Code2.ipynb)\n","\n","[Answer sheet of ML3-1](ml_tutorial/ML3/ML3_Code1_Answer.ipynb)\n","\n","---\n","### **ML 4: Data analysis 4**\n","\n","[ML4-1: Data Dim.
