There are two common approaches for weighting:\n","\n","- *Uniform*: All neighbors have equal weight when contributing to the prediction.\n","- *Distance*: Neighbors closer to the query point have a higher weight when contributing to the prediction. This can help to give more importance to closer points, which might be more relevant in some cases.\n","\n",".\n","\n","2. **n_neighbors**: The number of neighbors to consider when making a prediction. A small value of n_neighbors leads to a more flexible model that may be more sensitive to noise, while a large value of n_neighbors can result in a smoother decision boundary that may not capture the underlying patterns in the data. Selecting the appropriate value for n_neighbors is critical for the model's performance.\n","\n",".\n","\n","3. **Metric**: The metric defines how the distance between data points is calculated.
