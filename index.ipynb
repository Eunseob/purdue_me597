The lab sessions will be broken down into four main \n","parts as followed.\n","\n","\n","\n","1. Data collection: IoT sensor connectivity, and communication\n","\n","  a. Sensors: temperature, humidity, and accelerometer\n","\n","  b. Industry standard protocol: power meter (Modbus protocol), vibration (IO-Link)\n","  \n","  c.

Each TASK is worth 2 to 5 pt credit. The maximum score of the prelab and lab reports is 10 pt each. Please do not miss any lab. If you skip a lab, it is hard to catch up with the following labs. You have to submit each assignment in both Jupyter Notebook format (*.ipynb) and PDF formats in time via Brightspace. No late submissions are accepted without the agreement of the instructor and TA. The due date rule is 1) the prelab report due date is before the lab and 2) the lab report due date is before the next lab. For example, if Lab 1 and Lab 2 start at 3:00 pm on Jan. 11 and Jan. 25, respectively, the Prelab1 report due is before 3:00 pm on Jan. 11, and the Lab1 and Prelab2 report due is before 3:00 pm on Jan. 25.
