The schematic of the example system for the dashboards is shown in Figure 4. This is important because you should create the same system by accessing the measurement data from sensors at the end of this lab. As we performed in Lab5, \n","MTConnect adapter simulator is being used. The target sensors are 1) DHT11, 2) ADXL345, and 3) power meter. The example data are shown in Figure 3. These example data for approximately 3 minutes are repeating continuously and infinitely in the MTConnect adapter simulator. All simulated data is transmitted to MTConnect agent. \n","\n","![picture](https://github.com/hewp84/tinyml/blob/main/img/L8_Figure3.png?raw=true)\n","\n","*Figure 3 Example data for the example dashboard*\n","\n","![picture](https://github.com/hewp84/tinyml/blob/main/img/L8_Figure4.png?raw=true)\n","\n","*Figure 4 Schematic of example system*\n","\n","The information about the system is summarized as follows. \n","* MTConnect agent: http://me597server1.ecn.purdue.edu:5000/ \n","* MySQL server DNS (same as Lab7): http://me597server1.ecn.purdue.edu\n","  * Port: 3306 \n","  * Database: ME597Spring22\n","  * Table: grafana_sample \n","  * Table schema is the same as Lab7.
