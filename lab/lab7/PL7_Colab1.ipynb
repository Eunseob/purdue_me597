Grafana is an open-source interactive visualization web dashboard application. Grafana provides various visualization functionalities, such as charts, tables, time series graphs, statistics, and alerts for the web according to the supported data sources. As data sources, Grafana supports both SQL and NoSQL. Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where you are stored. It enables to create, explore, and share dashboards. Major features of Grafana are as follows<sup>1</sup>.\n","\n","* Visualization\n","  * Fast and flexible client-side graphs with a multitude of options. Panel plugins offer many ways to visualize metrics and logs \n","* Dynamic Dashboards\n","  * Create dynamic & reusable dashboards with template variables that appear as dropdown at the top of the dashboard. \n","\n","* Explore Metrics\n","  * Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drilldown. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side. \n","* Explore Logs\n","  * Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search through all your logs or streaming them live. \n","* Alerting\n","  * Visually define alert rules for your most important metrics. Grafana will continuously evaluate and send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie. \n","* Mixed Data Sources\n","  * Mix different data sources in the same graph! You can specify a data source on a per-query basis. This works for even custom data sources. \n","\n","  ![picture](https://github.com/hewp84/tinyml/blob/main/img/PL8_Figure1.jpg?raw=true)\n","\n","  *Figure 1 Example of web dashboard using Grafana*\n","\n","* Grafana official website: https://grafana.com/  \n","\n","* Grafana Live Demo: https://play.grafana.org/d/000000012/grafana-play-home?orgId=1 (available on Mar. 7, 2022)\n","\n","---\n","<sup>1</sup>Grafana GitHub: https://github.com/grafana/grafana"],"metadata":{"id":"yrBoHsLrHPLI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2 Preparation for Visualization\n","\n","In Lab7, we will visualize the stored data in MySQL database using Grafana so that you can see graphs and charts in the web browser. Also, we will create the entire data collection and visualization data stream from the sensor, edge computer, MTConnect, and database eventually to Grafana web dashboard as shown in Figure 2.
