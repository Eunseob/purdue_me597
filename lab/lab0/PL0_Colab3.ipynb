When the SD card is connected to your laptop, you can format the card in the Raspberry Pi Imager. With the Imager open, click \"Choose OS\" and select Raspberry Pi OS 10 (“Buster”). To do so, click ‘Raspberry Pi OS (others)’ and then choose ‘Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy)’ as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively.\n",
