By MTConnect adapter simulation, we got to know the data stream from MTConnect adapter to MTConnect agent. In addition, we practiced the client request to MTConnect agent via HTTP request. \n","\n","The purpose of Lab 5 is 1) to program MTConnect adapters in various configurations and 2) to be familiar with the client application (data collection via HTTP request and XML parsing). In this prelab, we will practice Python programming for MTConnect adapter and XML parsing.  However, in Prelab 5, we will mainly practice and understand MTConnect adapter Python programming by generating random data. \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"biN-99_l9Isd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2 MTConnect Adapter\n","\n","\n","In this prelab, we will program a simple Python code to run MTConnect adapter by generating random values without sensors. The schematic of MTConnect configuration is illustrated in Figure 1. The data item configuration is shown in Figure 2.The laptop plays the role of both MTConnect agent and MTConnect adapter. Before we collect data directly from the sensors, ADXL345 and DHT11, let’s try to make random values assumed by the sensors as the MTConnect data transmission. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/prelab5_fig1.png?raw=true\" width=\"80%\">\n","\n","*Figure 1 MTConnect Schematic*\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/prelab5_fig2.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 2 Data item configuration*\n","\n","For the MTConnect agent, you are able to reuse the complied execution file and other files from Lab 4. It would be better to make copy of the MTConnect agent directory every time rather than modify it every time in the original MTConnect agent. For the MTConnect agent set up, please follow procedure below. \n","\n","1. Make the Host IP address and the Port of the *‘Adapter1’* as *‘127.0.0.1’* and *‘7878’*, respectively \n","\n","  a.\tAgain, 127.0.0.1 IP address means the machine host itself. That has the same meaning as localhost. Therefore, if you make ‘Host’ as ‘localhost’, it works as well. \n","\n","  b.\tAlso, in the configuration file (*‘agent.cfg’*), The ‘#’ mark in front of the line means comment out the line as Python does. Therefore, MTconnect agent ignores the lines starting with '#'.\n","\n","  c.\tIn this example, the Port number for the agent is 5000.

The response will look like Figure 3. Because only X-axis acceleration (id = *‘a1’*) and temperature (id = *‘t1’*) values are added as the data items of MTConnect adapter and having the random values, other data items are still showing ‘UNAVAILABLE’. When the MTConnect adapter is made a connection to the agent, the EVENT item id ‘avail’ is changed to ‘AVAILABLE’. In reverse, the MTConnect adapter isn’t made a connection to the agent, it is changed to ‘UNAVAILABLE’. Therefore, by checking the ‘Availability’ (id = ‘avail’) we can see whether the adapter is connected to the agent well or not. If the adapter is connected but the SAMPLE values (sensor data) are not changing, we may consider the issues on the sensor data access. Please note that to halt (forcedly stop) the MTConnect adapter, the shortcut on the terminal is Ctrl + c. And the printing out values is to see what values are transmitting to the agent. \n","\n","\n","   <img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/prelab5_fig3.png?raw=true\" width=\"80%\">\n","\n","*Figure 3 Capture of web browser of ‘current’ request to agent after running sample code*\n","\n","---\n","\n","<sup>1</sup>For this lab, MTConnect adapter based on Python was modified from https://github.com/mtconnect/PocketNC_adapter.
