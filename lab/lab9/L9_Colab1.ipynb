This lab is broken down into three main sections: **1) Understanding and analyzing data, 2) Machine learning implementation to Raspberry Pi**, and **3) Building up the entire monitoring system.** The entire monitoring system and the data pipeline are illustrated in Figure 1. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab9_fig1.png?raw=true\" width=\"100%\">\n","\n","*Figure 1 Schematic of entire monitoring system and data pipeline*"],"metadata":{"id":"h3GlJwurL3PT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2 Acceleration of the AFF\n","\n","\n","In this section, we will go over the algorithm of the smart monitoring system and determine some variables for the smart monitoring system. The goal of the monitoring system for the AFF is to visualize in real-time 1) the vibration of the AFF, 2) the execution (‘ACTIVE’ or ‘STOPPED’), and 3) the prediction of running condition (‘NORMAL’ or ‘ABNORMAL’). Obviously, the prediction of running conditions based on the machine learning model should be only done when the AFF is in an ‘ACTIVE’ state. If the AFF is not running, the prediction of anomaly does not mean anything. \n","\n","The algorithm and the flowchart of the AFF monitoring system is illustrated in Figure 2. This data flow will be repeated in a loop in your program. In Lab8, we developed an anomaly detection model (Autoencoder) for the second decision (“Is AFF normal?”). But we do not have a model for the first decision (“Is AFF running?”). Of course, a model to determine the running state (‘ACTIVE’ or ‘STOPPED’) can be developed by using machine learning approach as we performed in Lab8. However, let’s make the simplest rule based on the measured vibration data. The idea is that when the AFF is running, the acceleration of each axis of the sensor must increase. Therefore, based on a simple logic such as a certain axis acceleration is lower than a specific acceleration value, a threshold on running, we can determine if the AFF is running or not. In other words, if the acceleration of a certain axis is higher than the threshold value, we can say the AFF is running, e.i., ‘Execution’ of AFF is ‘ACTIVE’. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab9_fig2.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 2 Flow chart of AFF monitoring system*\n","\n","The sample plots according to the various conditions of the AFF are in [APPENDIX](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DyKTOPtkSiUWEnzS9-gDQo_zrrfp1U7v#scrollTo=LfQ-rS3gD6Z3&line=1&uniqifier=1) at the end of this manual. On the time domain plots, you can see the RMS values according to the axis. As you can see, when the machine is stopped (Figure A. 2), the RMS (root mean square) accelerations are the minimum on the x- and y-axis. The sample data shows that it is reasonable to set the execution rms threshold of the x-axis as 1 m/s2. However, the rms threshold value may be different according to the AFF, and the sensor configurations. \n","TASK 1\n","\n","First, **deploy ADXL345 sensor to the AFF as the same to Lab9**.

When training and validating the model, we used the normalized data set. Other than the threshold (mae, mean absolute error, loss) for the autoencoder model, when you implement the model to Raspberry Pi, you need to use the minimum and the maximum to normalize the extracted features in order to employ your model. The data flow in real time to predict running conditions of the AFF is illustrated in Figure 4. To normalize the input feature, we should know the minimum and the maximum values when training.
