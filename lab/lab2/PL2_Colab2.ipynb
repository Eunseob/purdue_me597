The sample code for generating and visualization of signals is uploaded on Brightspace (prelab3_signal_processing_sample.py). The scenario is that sampling frequency (f<sub>s</sub>), sampling period (T), and number of samples (N) are 100 Hz, 0.01 sec-1, and 100, respectively. Therefore, total length of the signal is 100 for 1 second. The sample signal (x) are combinations of three signals (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, and x<sub>noise</sub>). The first signal, x<sub>1</sub>, is sine wave signal with 10 Hz main frequency and amplitude 2. The second signal, x<sub>2</sub>, is cosine wave signal with 15 Hz main frequency and amplitude 1.5. The third signal, x<sub>noise</sub>, is random signal of normal distribution from 0 to 0.3. By summing three signals, x can be defined as Eq. (1). \n","\n","(1): \n","\n","---\n","$x[n] = x_{1}[n] + x_{2}[n] + x_{noise}[n]$\n","\n","---\n","\n","where n is sample index.
