The ADXL345 is a cheap and low-power accelerometer with a high resolution (13-bit) measurement at up to ±16 g. Measurement is performed by digital output data formatted as 16bit and accessible through either an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) or I2C (or I2C, IIC, Inter-Integrated Circuit) digital interface. We will use the I2C method to access data of the sensor using Adafruit ADXL Python package (https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/adxl34x/en/latest/, available on Jan. 25, 2023). Also, signal processing of collected data is one of the major keys in data analytics. \n","\n","Prelab 2 is to prepare to use the ADXL345 sensor module and signal processing with visualization of signal in Raspberry Pi.
