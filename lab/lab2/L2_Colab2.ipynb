Do not remove the tapes because it can move due to aerodynamic force when running. Flip ADXL345 sensor and then peel off the film from the bottom of the breadboard as Figure 11 (left). However, do not throw away the film because you need to reuse the file to protect adhesive so that the double-sided tape remains adhesion for next time use. And then attach your sensor on top of the axial flow fan as Figure 11 (right). Total 3 sensors can be attached to the fan. Please do this together with other table members.\n",
