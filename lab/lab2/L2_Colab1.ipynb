Measuring the vibration of machinery gives us the physical behavior of it and helps us to model the system. If we have enough data set of the machinery in several cases, of course, we can develop a machine learning (ML) model as a data-driven machine monitoring approach. In Lab2, we will measure the accelerations of machinery and perform basic signal processing. ADXL345 module and an axial flow fan will be used for the accelerometer and the target machine, respectively. \n","\n","\n","ADXL345 is a small, low power, complete three-axis MEMS accelerometer module accessible with SPI and I2C interfaces. The block diagram of the sensor is shown in Figure 1. According to the sensor module manufacturers, the module consists of 8- or 9-Pinout. The ADXL345 is good for many applications such as static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing, dynamic acceleration resulting from motion or shock. In case of tilt-sensing, it measures inclination changes less than 1.0°. The selected specifications of ADXL345 are summarized in Table 1.\n","\n","If you need, visit ANALOG DEVICE web page (https://www.analog.com/en/products/adxl345.html) and see the data sheet. The maximum output data rate is 3200 Hz, and the minimum is 0.1 Hz. We will try to use both the maximum and the minimum output data rates in Lab2. To read/measure acceleration values of each axis, we will use I2C interface of Raspberry Pi and Adafruit Python package (ADXL34X, https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/adxl34x/en/latest/, available on Jan. 26, 2023). \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab2_fig1.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 1 Functional block diagram of ADXL345<sup>1</sup>*\n","\n","*Table 1 ADXL345 specifications<sup>1</sup>*\n","\n","<table width=\"671\">\n","<tbody>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"270\">\n","<p>Parameter</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"175\">\n","<p>Conditions</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>Min</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"160\">\n","<p>Typical</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>Max</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>Unit</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Measurement Range</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>User selectable</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&plusmn;2 (default), &plusmn;4, &plusmn;8, &plusmn;16</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>g</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Nonlinearity</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>Percentage of full scale</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&plusmn;0.5</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>%</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Inter-axis alignment error</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&plusmn;0.1</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>&deg;</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Cross-axis sensitivity</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&plusmn;1</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>%</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Output resolution</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>10</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>10</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>13</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>Bits</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Sensitivity deviation from ideal</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>All g-range</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&plusmn;1</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>%</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Sensitivity change due to temperature</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&plusmn;0.01</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>%</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Output data rate</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>User selectable</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>0.1 (default)</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>3200</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>Hz</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Operating voltage range</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>2</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>2.5</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>3.6</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>V</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Operating temperature range</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>-40</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>85</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>&deg;C</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr>\n","<td width=\"198\">\n","<p>Weight</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"150\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>30</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"94\">\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","</td>\n","<td width=\"42\">\n","<p>mg</p>\n","</td>\n","</tr>\n","</tbody>\n","</table>\n","\n","\n","For the target machine, we will use an axial flow fan, AXIAL HS1238A (AC INFINITY Inc.) shown in Figure 2.

Axis orientation of ADXL345*\n","\n","The axis orientation of ADXL345 is shown Figure 5. You can find the orientation on top of the sensor as well. This sensor follows the right-hand rule of Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, if you know positive x- and ydirection, you can define positive z-direction. Because of the gravity of the Earth, it measures reaction acceleration in the positive z-direction in the case of the orientation as Figure 5. The gravitational acceleration of the Earth is approximately 9.81 m/s2 in the negative z-direction. So, if your sensor orientation is as Figure 5, the zdirection acceleration should be around +9.81 m/s2 and the others should be around 0 m/s2. Try to change the sensor orientations such as vertically erecting, flipping the assembly while the code is running and see if it measures the change of accelerations. You may think of various applications from this measurement. For example, by calculating the accelerations of the sensor, you can predict the orientation of the target object such as the robot arm, the moving axis of a machine, and so on.
