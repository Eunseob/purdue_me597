An autoencoder we practiced in Prelab8 will be employed to determine whether AFF is in a normal or abnormal condition. Lab8 is broken down into two main sections: **1) Data collection**, and **2) Training ML model**. In the data collection section, we will collect accelerometer data when the machine is in normal and abnormal conditions using Raspberry Pi. The abnormal condition will be set of increasing eccentric force by adding a mass on a blade of the AFF as Lab2. In the training ML model section, we will utilize the given scripts in Prelab8 to train an autoencoder. In addition, we will perform feature engineering by doing signal processing to see the effects of input feature on the performance of the ML models. And the, we will save the selected and trained model to local disk to use it in the next lab. The schematic of Lab9 is illustrated in Figure 1.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab8_fig1.png?raw=true\" width=\"100%\">\n","\n","*Figure 1 Lab8: Schematic of anomaly detection model training for axial flow fan*"],"metadata":{"id":"ygT_wNmDBiB3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Collection for Machine Learning"],"metadata":{"id":"80WledH5BmNd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 1: Data collection practice\n","\n","First, make a wire connection between ADXL345 sensor and Raspberry Pi.

The hardware configuration and the speed controller are shown in Figure 3. For safety reasons, the base part is fixed on the table using tapes. Do not remove the tapes because it maybe move when you run the AFF due to aerodynamic forces. To turn on the fan, rotate the knob of the speed controller clockwise. The relationship between knob pointer placements and the actual rotational speed of AFF is shown in Table 2. When you rotate the pointer of the knob to L (Speed 1 in Figure 3 (right)), for example, the AFF rotates around 1800 rpm. By adjusting the control knob, you can increase and decrease the rotating speed of the fan. Different from the vacuum pump case of Prelab9, it is obvious that changing rotational speed makes an ML model development hard. On the other hand, it may be more interesting. For instance, if you attach the unbalanced mass to a blade of the fan at the lowest rotational speed, does the amplitude of vibration be bigger than the maximum rotational speed without any attached mass? We don’t know the answer exactly but probably no. Turn the fan on and adjust the knob to see if the rotation speed changes well. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab8_fig3.png?raw=true\" width=\"100%\">\n","\n","*Figure 3 Configuration of axial flow fan (left) and speed controller (right)*\n","<br></br>\n","*Table 2 Controller indicator vs. rotational speed of AFF*\n","\n","<table width=\"60%\">\n","<thead>\n","  <tr>\n","    <th align=\"center\">Speed indiator</th>\n","    <th align=\"center\">Rotational Speed</th>\n","  </tr>\n","</thead>\n","<tbody>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td align=\"center\">1 (L, Low)</td>\n","    <td align=\"center\">1800 rpm</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td align=\"center\">2</td>\n","    <td align=\"center\">2150 rpm</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td align=\"center\">3 (M, Middle)</td>\n","    <td align=\"center\">2500 rpm</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td align=\"center\">4</td>\n","    <td align=\"center\">2750 rpm</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td align=\"center\">5 (H, High)</td>\n","    <td align=\"center\">3000 rpm</td>\n","  </tr>\n","</tbody>\n","</table>\n","\n","Deploy the accelerometer (ADXL345) on the top of the fan as Figure 4. **You have to remember the sensor placement and the axis configuration for the next lab again.** If you are not sure how to set up the accelerometer to the AFF, please look at [Lab2.2 manual](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/lab2/L2_Colab2.ipynb).
