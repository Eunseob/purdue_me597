Reference the picture below to see neurons & layers and how they are portrayed in a visualized ML model. If you want to play with the website used in this screenshot, go to ' https://playground.tensorflow.org/ '.\n","  \n","  <img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/prelab8_img1.png?raw=true\" width=\"60%\">\n","\n","* Model\n","  * The product of training and data sets. When \"machine learning\" happens, it is usually the model making inferences on data given to it. See the figure below.\n","\n","  <img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/prelab8_fig3.png?raw=true\" width=\"50%\">\n","\n","  *Figure 3 A \"model\"<sup>1</sup>*\n","\n","* Training\n","  * The process of determining the best \"fit\" for the model. After a bunch of iterations, a model will be trained for making good inferences. Seeing figure 2 above, that \"Repeat\" process is the training process.\n","* \"Fit\"ness\n","  * As an ML Engineer, you can either underfit or overfit a model. If a model is underfit, it will not make good inferences on the data used to train the model and will not make good inferences on the real-world/unknown data. An overfit model will be super good at the training data, but when in the real-world, it will not be good. Take a look at the figure below.\n","\n","  <img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/prelab8_img2.png?raw=true\" width=\"60%\">\n","\n","* Epochs\n","  * The amount of times the process in Figure 2 is repeated. When training a model, the algorithm will run through multiple iterations to minimize the loss as much as possible.\n","\n","* Visualizing\n","  * Visualizing helps the ML Enginineer (you) determine if you have appropiately tuned your model (the parameters) according to your data set. Typically, neural networks are seen as \"black boxes\" -- it is hard for humans to make reliable inferences based on the machine learning code, layer decisions, neuron decisions, etc.\n","\n","\n","### Exploring how neurons, layers, and algorithms change the efficiency of our chosen ML model\n","\n","We will use the website ' https://ml-playground.com/ ' to form our intuitions and gain a better understanding of how the different neurons, layers, and machine learning algorithms effect a model.\n","\n","This website allows you to click Orange and Purple dots to form data points, then choose an algoritm to train your model. Once selecting an algorithm, you'll see there are choices to let you tune your parameters. This algorithm, with parameters, is how your model will be trained. This process is visualized and simplified to help you build intuition.\n","\n","The screenshot below shows a fit model. By looking at the data points, it is safe to say the algorithm should classify half orange and half purple, although there are data points, or anomalies, on either side of the opposite color. You can see in the bottom right that there are 2 layers with 2 neurons each. These parameters were chosen after trial-and-error to find the best one. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/prelab8_img3.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","The screenshot below shows an overfit model. You see, the data is roughly split 50/50 by a diagonal line. However, the colored regions show where the model would predict a data point to be. And, in this case it would not infer correctly. It is too fit for the training data, and if we introduced new data (real-world / unknown data), it would not draw accurate inferences.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/prelab8_img4.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","There is not an example provided for the underfit model, that is your Task.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"n5xOF0w3sU8e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Task 3\n","Draw data points wherever you see fit.
