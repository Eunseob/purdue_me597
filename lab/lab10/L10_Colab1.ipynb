This lab is broken down into three main sections: **1) Utilize MTConnect sound data stream**, **2) Implement a CNN model you developed in the prelab using TensorFlow Lite**, and **3) Build up the entire monitoring system.** \n","\n","To get started, Figure 1 illustrates a simplified sound recognition system. IIoT technologies and embedded machine learning models realize this system. The idea is that the Raspberry Pi listens to sound from the machine and recognize the operational state by AI model, and then we are able to monitor remotely the real-time state via a web-based dashboard. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab10_fig1.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 1 Simplified system configuration of vacuum pump sound recognition for Lab 10*\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","Details of the system configuration and data flow are shown in Figure 2. Please take a close look at Figure 2. Let's say the MTConnect stream for sound is \"sub-MTConnect\" for sound to distinguish it from the MTConnect for results. First, the internal sound sensor connected to the headless computer captures analog sound signals and then converts them to digital signals. Second, the sub-MTConnect adapter samples, formats, and converts them to the sub-MTConnect agent. Therefore, as long as a client is accessible via TCP/IP to the headless computer, it can read the sound stream using the sub-MTConnect agent in real-time. Third, the edge computer (Raspberry Pi) gets the sound stream and takes a signal processing for the input feature of the CNN model that we developed in Prelab 10. For AI implementation, we utilize TensorFlow Lite on Raspberry Pi. Fourth, the outputs of the CNN model with the AI algorithm are taken to MTConnect. Fifth, the MTConnect data collector program aggregates MTConnect agent data and sends them to the MySQL database. Lastly, Grafana dashboard with the MySQL database can let end users know the current/history running state of the vacuum pump.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zMGw3LA8-5nN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab10_fig2.png?raw=true\" width=\"100%\">\n","\n","*Figure 2 Detailed system configuration and data flow for Lab 10*"],"metadata":{"id":"x_ZERkf6r_E5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2 Sensor and server information\n","\n","Here, sensor specifications and server information (for MySQL and Grafana services) are summarized for your convenience, even though you are able to find the information in the previous prelab and lab manuals.\n","\n","Sensor specifications including the sub-MTconnect sound stream are in Table 1.
