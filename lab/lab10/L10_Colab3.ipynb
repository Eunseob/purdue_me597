To do this, we will use TensorFlow Lite. TensorFlow Lite has limited features but is faster and lighter than TensorFlow. When you install TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi and laptop, TensorFlow Lite module is automatically installed. Because it supports Keras interface, TensorFlow Lite is able to load and run the CNN model developed in the prelab using TensorFlow and Keras.\n","\n","The best way to practice implementation of the trained model is to program yourself. Because of the limited time in the lab, however, the complete sample code ([lab10_sample2.py](https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/lab10/lab10_sample_code/lab10_sample2.py?raw=true)) is given.

The terminal or output shell looks like as Figure 5. **Note that if you develop the CNN model with different feature size and shape, you have to modify the sample code.** An algorithm to interpret the CNN model output is incomplete as part of the sample code below. Complete the algorithm so that appropriate label is printed out at the end.
