Let's make an entire monitoring system as [Figure 1](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/lab10/L10_Colab1.ipynb#scrollTo=x_ZERkf6r_E5). Depending on the project or system requirements, you skip the MTConnect part. However, considering the potential use of MTConnect to collect machine data in the future, design and create an MTConnect agent to collect and merge the running state prediction (Event) and sound level (Sample) of the vacuum pump.\n","\n","The idea is that we know both the execution state (OFF/ON, Event) and the vacuum state (Vacuuming/Air leaking, Event) from the CNN model. Also, we calculate the sound level (Sample).
