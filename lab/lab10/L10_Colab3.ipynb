To do this, we will use TensorFlow Lite. TensorFlow Lite has limited features but is faster and lighter than TensorFlow. When you install TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi and laptop, TensorFlow Lite module is automatically installed. Because it supports Keras interface, TensorFlow Lite is able to load and run the CNN model developed in the prelab using TensorFlow and Keras.\n","\n","The best way to practice implementation of the trained model is to program yourself.
