MTConnect agent is a form of middleware that provides a service to client applications that require data from specified manufacturing equipment or sensors. The agent needs to receive a stream of data directly from a compliant device or from a software adapter. The data stream is received by the agent and buffered in a circular buffer. Upon request (HTTP) from a client, the agent binds the buffered data to the device data model (device.xml) and provides the appropriate response XML (Extensible Markup Language) document (*.xml). \n","\n","Typical MTConnect architecture is shown in Figure 1. There are 3 different cases of MTConnect architecture. \n","Of course, mixed configurations from each case are applicable. An agent can support multiple machines. Adapters can be provided by the manufacturer of the machine and sensor or developed. In addition, adapter can reside 1) on the machine’s controller, 2) connected to the PLC wires and controller, and 3) remotely if the machine communicates using a network protocol. Applications only communicate with MTConnect agent. The data streamflow of MTConnect is unidirectional from the device to the application. It means that a client application is only accessible to read-only data from MTConnect agent. MTConnect does not allow to write data to MTConnect agent by a client. We may think a lot of applications such as real-time web-based monitoring, creating digital twins, data analytics, and so on. Therefore, the applications are differed by demands. \n","\n","The purpose of Lab4 is to create a basic MTConnect agent stream in various network configurations and to request MTconnect agent data as a client application. In addition, by simulating MTConnect adapter, we will make data stream for MTConnect agent to understand and practice it. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab4_fig1.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 1 MTConnect architecture*\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hhaPMTC1ukj7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2 MTConnect Agent Overview\n","\n","\n","Compiled MTConnect agent execution files upon the operating system and computer architecture and required files are prepared on [Github repo](https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/tree/main/lab/lab4/MTConnect_agent).
