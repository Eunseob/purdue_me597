However, to see the data stream flow of MTConnect agent, we will simulate MTConnect adapter. The simulation data ([Sensor_log.txt](https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/lab4/MTConnect_simulator/Sensor_log.txt?raw=true)) and simulation adapter ([run_scenario.rb](https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/lab4/MTConnect_simulator/run_scenario.rb?raw=true)) programmed by ruby are on the Github repo [here](https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/tree/main/lab/lab4/MTConnect_simulator). Please download two files on Raspberry Pi. Please note that two files must be in the same directory in this example. The schematic of the simulation is shown in Figure 8. Raspberry Pi will run MTConnect adapter simulator and data streams are transmitted to the MTConnect agent of laptop. The data log file (‘Sensor_log.txt’) using Lab1 and Lab2 codes was created by collecting both ADXL345 sensor data (3-axis accelerations) and DHT11 (humidity and temperature). Two sensors have different sampling frequencies. In this scenario, sampling periods are 1 second and 3 seconds, respectively. The length of simulation data is 3 minutes, but we will simulate repeating the data continuously. The plots of the data are shown in Figure 9.  \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab4_fig8.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 8 MTConnect schematic for simulation*\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab4_fig9.png?raw=true\" width=\"100%\">\n","\n","*Figure 9 Simulation data (‘Sensor_log.txt’): ADXL345 acceleration (left) and DHT11 (right)*\n","\n","First, you need to specify Adapter information in the agent configuration file (‘agent.cfg’) before running.
