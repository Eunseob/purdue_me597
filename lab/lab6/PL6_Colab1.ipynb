In Lab 5 and 6, we learned MTConnect as a middleware to integrate data flow. Because data size in the MTConnect agent is limited to the memory size of the computer, introducing database is needed to store data for long-term use. \n","\n","There are many different types of databases. Normally the types of databases are divided into SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (non SQL or not only SQL). The selection of a proper database is important when you start a project. Of course, NoSQL can be better in many applications. However, of the various databases, we will use SQL (Structured Query Language) database, specifically MySQL. SQL is a standardized programing “language” that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. Because SQL database is elementary of database, we will use SQL for the lab activities. SQL allow us to store, update, and retrieve data in databases. MySQL is an open-source (royalty free) relational database management system (RDBMS). It is developed by Oracle Co. MySQL is a representative RDBMS and it is used by many popular websites, including Facebook, Flickr, YouTube and so on. \n","\n","The purpose of Lab 7 is 1) to understand the basic syntax of SQL and 2) to manipulate (store and retrieve) databases. As a hands-on activity, we will store sensor data into MySQL database using SQL and retrieve data from it. \n"],"metadata":{"id":"NDJMI3eUjf78"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2 MySQL Python Package Installation on Raspberry Pi\n","\n","In Lab 7, we will program a Python script to store sensor data into MySQL database.
