As the power meter data collection, your computers (laptop and Raspberry Pi) are on the router network. The IO-Link master is also on the same router network with a static IP address. The ethernet cable (RJ45) is used for connection between the router and the IO-Link master. Note that the IO-Link vibration sensor is connected to the **port 1** of the master. In this case using REST API, each of your computer is not a master but client. The IO-Link master is a server. The data communication sequence to read data from the IO-Link master is summarized as follows.\n","\n","1.  The computer (Raspberry Pi or laptop) requests data using REST API's post method to the IO-Link master \n","2.  The IO-Link master read the IO-Link sensor data by the IO-Link protocol\n","3.  The IO-Link master sends back the received data from the IO-Link sensor to the computer as the JSON format.\n","4.  The computer receives the JSON data and parse it.\n","\n","To do this, we will use Python and 'requests' and 'json' packages which are the basic packages in Python.
