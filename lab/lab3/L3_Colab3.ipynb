As the power meter data collection, your computers (laptop and Raspberry Pi) are on the router network. The IO-Link master is also on the same router network with a static IP address. The ethernet cable (RJ45) is used for connection between the router and the IO-Link master. Note that the IO-Link vibration sensor is connected to the **port 1** of the master. In this case using REST API, each of your computer is not a master but client. The IO-Link master is a server.

This G-code is cut down the entire face of the workpiece in 10 mm depth with a 5 mm diameter end-mill of the z-axis. From the cutting condition (federate), and tool path, we can calculate how long the G-code takes. The entire will take around 10 minutes 20 seconds. TA will repeat running the same G-code throughout the lab. Even though the machine hardware is not connected to the CNC controller, it runs G-code and simulates the cutting.
