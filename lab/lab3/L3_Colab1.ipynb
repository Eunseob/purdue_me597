The purpose of Lab 4 is to collect data using industry standard IoT communications and protocols. We will collect data from two devices, 1) a multi-functional power meter and 2) an IO-Link vibration sensor via a IO-Link master, to practice industry IoT communication and data aggregation methods from devices equipped with IoT capabilities. It is not surprising that most, probably every, manufacturing equipment is operated by electrical power. Measuring power consumption plays an important role in operating the machine efficiently. In addition, vibration from machinary contains information of operation and wellness. These information are useful to determine performance of the machine and enable us to operate shop floor effectively. However, the available information depends on the device and communication. \n","\n","To monitor the power consumption of a machine, we will use a multi-functional power meter (AccuEnergy, [Acuvim-CL-D](https://www.accuenergy.com/products/acuvim-l-multifunction-power-energy-meter/)) and a current transformer (AccuEnergy, [AcuCT-H040-5:333](https://www.accuenergy.com/products/acuct-hinged-split-core-current-transformers/)).

The vacuum degassing system is used in many manufacturing and chemical industries to degas liquid, paste-like, and moist products. The mini-sized vacuum degassing system for Lab 3 is shown in Figure 4. To make a vacuum environment of it, a vacuum pump sucks out air from the chamber. It takes the standard AC voltage in the US which is 120 VAC (single-phase) 60 Hz. Here, without measurement, we expect that the measured voltage and frequency from the power meter are 120 Volt and 60 Hz, respectively. Let's confirm those in the following section.\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab3_fig4.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 4 Hardware configuration of vacuum degassing system*\n","\n","The entire system is shown in Figure 5.

The power meter is equipped with Modbus RTU communication option. Because Modbus RTU which uses serial communications cannot have multiple masters, we will use Modbus RTU (slave side) to Modbus TCP (master side) converter (Moxa, [MGate MB3180](https://www.moxa.com/en/products/industrial-edge-connectivity/protocol-gateways/modbus-tcp-gateways/mgate-mb3180-mb3280-mb3480-series)). The converter allows us to communicate the Modbus RTU device via Modbus TCP. Modbus RTU is limited to a single master with multiple slaves whereas multiple masters and multiple slaves’ configurations are possible if using Modbus TCP. Schematics of Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP are shown in Figure 7. Since Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP share and follow the standard Modbus protocol, it is possible to use converting data each other. In the most industry, Modbus RTU is commonly used due to cost and the reliability of data transmission. The main difference between Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP is mostly in the transport frames or the wrapper around the PDU (Protocol Data Unit). In both forms of Modbus, application specific addressing and error checking are attached to the PDU to make the ADU (Application Data Unit). In Modbus TCP is encapsulated in a TCP packet. The TCP protocol handless the error checking, which is why it is omitted from the Modbus TCP ADU. The comparisons of Modbus data frames are shown in Figure 8. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab3_fig6.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 6 Hardware configuration of power meter*\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab3_fig7.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 7 Schematics of Modbus RTU (top) and Modbus TCP (bottom)*\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/Eunseob/purdue_me597/blob/main/lab/img/lab3_fig8.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 8 Comparisons of Modbus frames: General (top), Modbus RTU (middle), and Modbus TCP (bottom)*\n","\n","The electrical wiring schematic for power meter is shown in Figure 9.

Using your existing architecture, IO-Link opens new possibilities to maximize the overall efficiency of your machines and processes. From easy and fast setup to additional machine monitoring data to process transparency from the machine level to the ERP software, IO-Link offers many benefits. See below for just some othe ways you can use IO-Link.\n","\n","The IO-Link master provides useful features. It separates between automation network and IT network so that we use the IT network for monitoring purpose. It has 8 ports to be connected to the IO-Link devices such as the vibration sensor. Moreover, it transmits machine data, process parameters and diagnostic data to the controller with ProfiNet (PLC/controller side) interface and separate MQTT JSON interface (IoT/ERP side) as Figure 10. In this lab, we will use JSON interface to extract vibration data from the IO-Link master.\n","\n","The sensor placement and hardware configuration are shown in Figure 11.
